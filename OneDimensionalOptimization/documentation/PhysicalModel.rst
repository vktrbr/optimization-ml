Problem statement
=============================================
1. Problem initializing:
    | We have function :math:`f(x)` and interval :math:`[\, a, b \, ]`.
    | It's necessary to create a function that finds the minimum of function on interval. In addition need to create an application for work with function.

2. Minimizing need to doing by 4 methods:
    1. Golden section search
    2. Successive parabolic interpolation
    3. Brent's method
    4. Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm

3. Requirements:
    1. Program needs to return :math:`x_{\min}\,`, :math:`f_{\min}, ` information about algorithm steps.
    2. Application needs to get a function, bounds, etc., to print work success message, to animate every steps of algorithm's work.
